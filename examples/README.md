# examples

Each example showcases a small part of the type language.

Before running an example, make sure the example subfolder is present in your `path-file.txt`. Then invoke `mtype` with the path to that file. Here's what your `path-file.txt` might look like:

```
/path/to/mtype/lang
/path/to/mtype/examples/trivial
/path/to/mtype/examples/record
...
```

Then, to run the `record` example: `mtype -sf -pf /path/to/path-file.txt make_person`.
